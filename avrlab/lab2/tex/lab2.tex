\section{Programing} 
\label{sec:programing}

Modify your program from lab 1 to display both digits on the 7 segment display.
You'll need to use a ``multiplexing'' method by switching the digits on and off
rapidly. You shouldn't need to modify the main method except to count up to $99$
instead of just $9$. Use \texttt{\_delay\_ms(...)} to control the timing for
multiplexing the 7 segment display.
